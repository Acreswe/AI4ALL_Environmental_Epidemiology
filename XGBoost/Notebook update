# QUICK NOTEBOOK UPDATE GUIDE

## What You Need to Do

Open your notebook and **change Cell 2** (the data loading cell).

---

## FIND AND REPLACE

### FIND these lines (they have long paths):

```python
df_pesticides2 = pd.read_csv('/Users/abciii/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Kil/AI4ALL/XGBoost_sets/historical_data_2000_2022_filtered.csv')
df_confounders = pd.read_csv('/Users/abciii/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Kil/AI4ALL/XGBoost_sets/copd_aqi_poverty_demographics.csv')
df_population = pd.read_csv('/Users/abciii/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Kil/AI4ALL/XGBoost_sets/Population_Census_Numbers_2000_2025.csv')
```

### REPLACE with these lines (short, simple paths):

```python
df_pesticides2 = pd.read_csv('Datasets/historical_data_2000_2022_filtered.csv')
df_confounders = pd.read_csv('Datasets/copd_aqi_poverty_demographics.csv')
df_population = pd.read_csv('Datasets/Population_Census_Numbers_2000_2025.csv')
```

## That's It!

Save the notebook (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S) and you're ready to share it on GitHub.

## Why This Change?

Your current paths point to YOUR computer's specific location:
- `/Users/abciii/Library/Mobile Documents/...`

The new paths are **relative paths** that work for anyone:
- `Datasets/filename.csv`

This means anyone who clones your repo just needs to create a `Datasets` folder and put the files there.
